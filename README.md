## Project Overview

The Green Crop Yield Prediction project aims to predict the crop yield based on various factors and features. This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to preprocess the data, select appropriate features, choose the best machine learning model, and make predictions. It also includes instructions on how to use the provided code and how to submit your predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the code)
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost)

### Installation

To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install required libraries: Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm catboost
   ```

3. Clone the project: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/green-crop-yield-prediction.git
   ```

4. Change directory: Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd green-crop-yield-prediction
   ```

## Data Preprocessing

### Importing Libraries

In this project, we use several Python libraries to preprocess and analyze the data. The following libraries are imported:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- catboost

### Loading and Understanding Data

We load the data from CSV files, understand the data's structure, and preprocess it. The provided code includes functions for loading data, converting date columns, handling categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection

We preprocess the data by handling missing values, selecting features, and preparing the data for machine learning models. Feature selection techniques, such as PCA and mutual information analysis, are applied to choose the most relevant features.

## Model Selection

### Feature Engineering and Model Selection

We use various machine learning models for predicting crop yield. The provided code includes models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, Elastic Net, and LightGBM. We evaluate and compare these models to select the best one for prediction.

### Model Evaluation

The project evaluates model performance using cross-validation and reports the root mean squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. You can find the RMSE values for each model in the project results.

### Model Deployment

The LightGBM model is chosen as the final model for deployment. You can make predictions using this model and submit your results.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the data by running the code for data preprocessing and feature selection.

2. Select the best model by running the model selection code and evaluating RMSE.

3. Deploy the LightGBM model for making predictions by following the provided code.

4. Use the model to predict crop yield for new data or test data.

5. Submit your predictions and check the results.

## Results

The project results include model evaluation metrics (RMSE) and a submission file for predictions. You can find the results in the project folder.
